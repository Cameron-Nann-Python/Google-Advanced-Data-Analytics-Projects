    "### **Task 4. Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, use the results of the models above to formulate a conclusion. Consider the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Would you recommend using this model? Why or why not?** \n",
    "\n",
    "The model performs better than a random classifier, and the performance is stable across the test set. The random forest classifier model should be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What was your model doing? Can you explain how it was making predictions?**   \n",
    "\n",
    "The model was splitting on class weights for the model features until a certain weight was reached for a leaf node to appear for each learner. The features that had the most effect on the model contributed to the largest reductions of impurity for the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Are there new features that you can engineer that might improve model performance?**   \n",
    "\n",
    "The trip distance, total amount, and trip duration can be segmented into categories that define long trips vs short trips, expensive trips vs cheap trips, fast trips vs slow trips. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What features would you want to have that would likely improve the performance of your model?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate tips, ratings on driver performance would be useful to access the personal experience that contributes to customers leaving larger tips.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, sometimes your data simply will not be predictive of your chosen target. This is common. Machine learning is a powerful tool, but it is not magic. If your data does not contain predictive signal, even the most complex algorithm will not be able to deliver consistent and accurate predictions. Do not be afraid to draw this conclusion. Even if you cannot use the model to make strong predictions, was the work done in vain? Consider any insights that you could report back to stakeholders."
